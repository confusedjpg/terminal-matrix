On a [MTWTFSS]-day night I was messing around with Dart and this very original idea emerged.

Features?
- falling green letters
- adaptive to terminal size (at start)
- very cool delta timing (don't talk to real devs about it)
- Dart code, you'll love it

Compile it yourself as there's all the files required in here.
Or take the executable from the releases page (only for Linux). If it doesn't work, I am partially sorry...*it works on my machine*!

Unlicense license, so feel free to print it and put it all over your city.
